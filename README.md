# react-fuzzy-filter

Fuzzy filter a list of data based on the search value typed in the input field. Each matching list item is made available as an argument to the FilterResults component's child function.

ReactFuzzyFilter is powered by [`fuse.js`](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse).

## Installation

```sh
npm install -S react-fuzzy-filter
```

## Example Usage

The default export of ReactFuzzyFilter is a factory function that returns two components, `InputFilter` and `FilterResults`. `FilterResults` receives the data typed into the `InputFilter` and uses it to fuzzy filter matches in its items. Each item is then rendered via a custom render function. Each invocation of the factory function creates two new "linked" components that can be used anywhere. The components do not need to live in the same component or part of the page.

```js
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import fuzzyFilterFactory from 'react-fuzzy-filter';

// these components share state and can even live in different components
const {InputFilter, FilterResults} = fuzzyFilterFactory();

class MyComponent extends Component {
  render() {
    const items = [
      { name: 'first', meta: 'first|123', tag: 'a' },
      { name: 'second', meta: 'second|443', tag: 'b' },
      { name: 'third', meta: 'third|623', tag: 'a' },
    ];
    const fuseConfig = {
      keys: ['meta', 'tag']
    };
    return (
      <div>
        <InputFilter debounceTime={200} />
        <div>Any amount of content between</div>
        <FilterResults
          items={items}
          fuseConfig={fuseConfig}>
          {filteredItems => {
            return(
              <div>
                {filteredItems.forEach(item => <div>{item.name}</div>)}
              </div>
            )
          }}
        </FilterResults>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Components

# InputFilter

An input field that controls the state used to render the items in `FilterResults`.

## Props

### classPrefix

`classPrefix` is a string that is used to prefix the class names in the component. It defaults to `react-fuzzy-filter`. (`react-fuzzy-filter__input`)

### initialSearch

`initialSearch` is an optional string that can override the initial search state when the component is created.

### inputProps

`inputProps` is an object containing additional props to be passed to the input field.

### onChange

`onChange` is an optional callback function that is called BEFORE the value in the input field changes via an `onchange` event. It can optionally return a string, which will then be passed directly to `FilterResults` rather than the original string. This can be used to filter out special inputs (eg: `author:jdlehman`) from fuzzy searching. These special inputs could then be used to change the `items` being passed to `FilterResults`.

### debounceTime

`debounceTime` is an optional number that denotes the time in milliseconds to debounce the `onChange` event on the input field. It defaults to 0.


# FilterResults

Collection of fuzzy filtered items (filtered by the `InputFilter`'s value), each being rendered by the custom render function (`renderItem` prop).

## Props

### fuseConfig

`fuseConfig` is an object that specifies configuration for [`fuse.js`](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse), the library that is doing the fuzzy searching. The only required key in this object is `keys`, which is an array that specifies the key(s), in the objects to use for comparison. Check out all of the configuration [options](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse#options).

### items

`items` is an array of the objects to be rendered. It defaults to an empty array.

### defaultAllItems

`defaultAllItems` is a boolean that determines whether all items should be shown if the search value is empty. It defaults to true (meaning all items are shown by default).

### prefilters

`prefilters` is an optional array of objects defining how to prefilter the items before they are handed off for fuzzy searching. Each object must have a `regex` key with a regular expression and a `handler` key with a callback function. Each regex match for a prefilter, will cause the corresponding handler to be called. The handler function receives the match as a string, the array of items (might be a subset if another prefilter has already happened), and the Fuse constructor function. The handler must return an array of items (probably a subset of what was passed in).

It is important to note that each match is stripped out of the search string that will be passed to the final fuzzy filtering with Fuse (after all matching prefilters have been run). This enables "commands" or special keywords to be used to filter the items, but not be used in the fuzzy search itself. Example: `author:jdlehman` might filter all the items that are authored by `jdlehman`, but the string `author:jdlehman` is not used to fuzzy search the filtered items. So a search with `author:jdlehman mySearch` could filter out all items that are not authored by `jdlehman` and then fuzzy search the remaining items with just `mySearch`.

The author prefilter described above might look like the following:

```js
const prefilters = [
  {
    regex: /author:\S+/g,
    handler: (match, items, Fuse) => {
      const name = match.split(':')[1];
      return items.filter(item => item.author === name);
    }
  }
];
```

We could also define a prefilter to fuzzy search on a different key then our default Fuse config. Example: `name:Bob` would fuzzy filter for `Bob` on the `name` key.


```js
const prefilters = [
  {
    regex: /\S+:\S+/g,
    handler: (match, items, Fuse) => {
      const [key, value] = match.split(':');
      const fuse = new Fuse(items, {keys: [key]});
      return fuse.search(value);
    }
  }
];
```
